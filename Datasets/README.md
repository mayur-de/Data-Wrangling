# Dataset Folder

This folder contains all datasets used in the data wrangling examples. Each dataset represents a unique real-world messy data scenario to demonstrate cleaning and transformation techniques in Python.

## Datasets

- **`Badly-Structured-Sales-Data-1.xlsx`**: Sales data with inconsistent rows, columns, and merged cells.
- **`Badly-Structured-Sales-Data-2.xlsx`**: Continuation of inconsistently structured sales data.
- **`Badly-Structured-Sales-Data-3.xlsx`**: More sales data with similar formatting issues.
- **`Badly-Structured-Sales-Data-4.xlsx`**: Additional examples of poorly formatted sales data.
- **`Hospital-Data-with-Mixed-Numbers-and-Characters.xlsx`**: Contains mixed numerical and textual data, requiring parsing and cleaning.
- **`Invoices-with-Merged-Categories-and-Merged-Amounts.xlsx`**: Invoice data with combined fields that need to be separated for analysis.
- **`Jumbled-up-Customers-Details.xlsx`**: Customer details stored in a disorganized format, with all details in a single column.
- **`Medicine-Data-with-lumped-Quantity-and-Measure.xlsx`**: Medicine data combining quantities and measurement units into one field.

## Purpose

Each dataset in this folder is used in a corresponding Jupyter notebook to demonstrate specific data wrangling techniques, such as:
- Cleaning messy text and numeric data
- Splitting and merging columns
- Handling merged cells and pivot tables
- Parsing inconsistent formats
